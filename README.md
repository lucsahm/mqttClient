# MQTT Web Client

This project is a lightweight web-based MQTT client that allows users to publish and subscribe to MQTT topics in real-time. The application is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, utilizing the Paho MQTT library for client-side communication with MQTT brokers.

## Features

- **Real-time Messaging**: Publish and subscribe to MQTT topics effortlessly.
- **QoS Support**: Select Quality of Service (QoS) levels for message delivery.
- **Retention Option**: Enable message retention to ensure messages are stored by the broker for new subscribers.
- **Sound Notification**: An alert sound plays when a new message is received, enhancing user experience.

## Audio File

This repository includes an audio file named `alerta.wav`. This sound is played as a notification when a new message arrives in the subscribed topic.

### To Use the Audio File:

1. Ensure the audio file is located in the same directory as the HTML file.
2. The sound will automatically play whenever a new message is received, provided the "Enable Sound" checkbox is checked.

Feel free to customize the audio file to fit your notification needs!
